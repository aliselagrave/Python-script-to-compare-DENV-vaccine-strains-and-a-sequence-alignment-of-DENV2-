# This program allows identifying the protein substitutions of a set of strains in comparison to a reference strain, and highlighting them in an Excel file.
#We used this Python script to compare DENV vaccine strains (Qdenga and Dengvaxia) and a sequence alignment of DENV2. 

# The data containing the strains must be in a .fa (FASTA) file.
